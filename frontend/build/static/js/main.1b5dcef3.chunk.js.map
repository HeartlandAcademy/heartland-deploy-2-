I want to pay tribute to all\r\n            staff, students and the entire community for managing this most\r\n            difficult period of times impacted by the pandemic sweeping the\r\n            world. Photos of individual student engagement, teaching and\r\n            learning from our dedicated staff and home learning activities\r\n            performed in partnership with our families have been inspirational.\r\n            To add to this, we have seen glimpses of student&#39;s brilliance\r\n            throughout Nursery, to grade 10 and into our college years. I want\r\n            to recognise all of you as you have been able to continue to keep\r\n            learning at the centre of your activities throughout this period. We\r\n            have seen fantastic college enrolments thus far and it is exciting\r\n            to see the year 12 exams just come to a close after much delay. We\r\n            wish these alumni well as they journey onto brilliant careers in\r\n            their chosen fields. Not to forget the brilliant work performed by\r\n            our HAND alumni team, continuing to provide community support and\r\n            individualised programs to support Nepal&#39;s youth. As things\r\n            start to open up, I have been encouraged at the news that our major\r\n            canteen development is now back up and running with building and\r\n            purchases now recommencing and to be able to share our new upgraded\r\n            IT labs with the community in a face-to-face capacity.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </Message0>\r\n        <Message1>\r\n          <img src={principal} alt=\"BOD\" />\r\n          <h3>Message from our Principal</h3>\r\n          <h5>Mr. Karan Singh Goyala</h5>\r\n          <p>HA Principal</p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Dear Parents, Guardians, and Heartland School Community, As the\r\n            Principal of Heartland Academy High School, I am very fortunate to\r\n            work with many dedicated, innovative and caring staff members,\r\n            parents and students. Each day is filled with new experience,\r\n            learning for all and the ability to make hundreds of the learners\r\n            day better; makes me proudly satisfied. Our School’s curriculum and\r\n            practices are consistently reviewed to ensure that we are following\r\n            the most updated best practices, meeting all regulations and\r\n            addressing the future needs of our students. Our staff consistently\r\n            follows current trends and in collaboration with administration,\r\n            creates a plan of action to incorporate those trends that are most\r\n            appropriate into the classrooms. One of the largest areas of growth\r\n            is the increased use of technology in our classrooms. Each student\r\n            is assigned a conceptual framework to input own effort in real\r\n            learning throughout the allocated time. The students at Heartland\r\n            School are offered many opportunities to explore their interests and\r\n            investigate new ideas. We offer many departmental facilities and\r\n            activities that our students can participate in.  Many of our\r\n            students are involved in a variety of co-curricular and\r\n            extracurricular activities that allow them the opportunity to\r\n            develop their skill and ability in solving future challenges\r\n            proactively. We pride ourselves in a personal approach and focus on\r\n            the development of character and moral values of each learner. And,\r\n            it is our belief that our children of today are our leaders of\r\n            tomorrow that they lead and serve to our community. I consider\r\n            myself very fortunate to be a team member of Heartland School. Each\r\n            day I am amazed by the little things the people of our school\r\n            community do for one another.  It is these daily reminders that make\r\n            our school nationally unique and special.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </Message1>\r\n        <Message2>\r\n          <img src={president} alt=\"BOD\" />\r\n          <h3>President of CLCR Nepal</h3>\r\n          <h5>Mr. Man Bahadur Ale</h5>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Education and training at Heartland &quot;Education is not the\r\n            filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire&quot;. Education is\r\n            one of the most powerful things in life. It allows us to find the\r\n            meaning behind everything and helps improve lives in a massive way.\r\n            Education provides us an understanding of the world around us and\r\n            offers us an opportunity to use that knowledge wisely. Heartland has\r\n            been providing Education and training packages to SEE graduated\r\n            students in Nepal for a number of years now. One of the main driving\r\n            forces of the school is to produce skilled manpower in the field of\r\n            education and higher education. We have been supporting students\r\n            with a practical approach to becoming a high-quality teacher and\r\n            after completion of studies can easily transition into their\r\n            teaching career. The school provides an education mentor to support\r\n            students in lesson planning, resource development, project work\r\n            designing, portfolio update and behaviour management. Including\r\n            education training at Heartland, we also have developed the concept\r\n            to extend the program throughout the whole country. We have been\r\n            working with different institutions in Kathmandu and out of the\r\n            valley. Education is the basic component of a human life. It is the\r\n            process of importing knowledge, skills, and judgement. Besides\r\n            education, people engage in various kinds of training as well. Both\r\n            of these aspects help to attain employment opportunities in human\r\n            life. Our graduate students are very competent in both teaching\r\n            practice and ICT as both are strong practical elements weaved into\r\n            our programs practices.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </Message2>\r\n        <Message3>\r\n          <img src={executive} alt=\"BOD\" />\r\n          <h3>Karuna Trust & CLCR Nepal Executive</h3>\r\n          <h5>Mr. Ram PD. Upadhaya</h5>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The COVID -19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life\r\n            worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health,\r\n            food systems and the world of work. The economic and social\r\n            disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions\r\n            of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty. Nepal is also\r\n            suffering badly. The situation of hospitals has further worsened due\r\n            to the pandemic. COVID patients have had difficulties to get oxygen\r\n            due to its high demand across the country and chronic health care\r\n            shortages. So, Heartland family is highly conscious to follow safety\r\n            protocols in this pandemic situation. We have targeted virtual\r\n            teaching learning practices to avoid Covid contamination. We also\r\n            have been able to get vaccination for Heartland teachers and staff\r\n            members and that will minimize COVID -19 risk among the school to\r\n            plan and work

It is a proven fact that the best way to learn is by\r\n          following our own curiosity and interests. In HA, we have tried to\r\n          create a free, self-motivated learning environment where natural\r\n          curiosity is not smothered, but nurtured. The result: motivated,\r\n          innovative, lifelong learners as our activities are built around a\r\n          carefully considered curriculum developed on a global scale. Our\r\n          school has an emergent curriculum which aims for both breadth and\r\n          balance and with high aspiration and expectation for all children. A\r\n          key aspect of the HA educational approach and teaching style is a\r\n          commitment to allowing children to develop at their own pace. In the\r\n          context of the carefully considered educational environment, we are\r\n          conﬁdent that children will engage with and develop conﬁdence and\r\n          competence over a wide range of important skills. It is important for\r\n          us to be clear that this means that we will not push a child into\r\n          development of any particular skill if the child is not ready. As part\r\n          of the HA continuous observation and assessment approach, we will\r\n          always be aware of the details of each child development, and be in a\r\n          position to discuss with parents our recommendations.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </Section3>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default AboutUs;\r\n","import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from

To begin, our motive is to\r\n          connect all the individual relating to Heartland or sharing similar\r\n          motive so that convenient way can be developed to open up problems of\r\n          mental health that one individual child is suffering. We very much\r\n          believe that children are the future of any nation so the physical or\r\n          mental fitness of child is very important. The main motive of HAND is\r\n          to work on child&#39;s psychology, behaviors &amp; morals. In general,\r\n          we can say child&#39;s mental health to improve and solve\r\n          psychological issues that adults frequently does. Well, HAND had\r\n          conducted numerous projects &amp; activities. Recently, we conducted\r\n          awareness program about corona pandemic through post on Facebook page\r\n          &amp; virtual zoom session where experts gave beneficial suggestions\r\n          on specific topics. Here, we discussed on 3 powerful topics like\r\n          Understanding Depression, Healthy Eating &amp; Healthy Thinking and\r\n          Google Classroom. The overall session went outstanding with huge\r\n          participation.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <img src={hand} alt=\"hand\" />\r\n          <br /> To begin, after we named organization as HAND, we have\r\n          conducted useful activities based on child&#39;s psychology. We had\r\n          kept stall on the occasion of science exhibition to promote HAND and\r\n          as well to inform people about our motive. Similarly, to know the\r\n          behaviors, thoughts, interests and morals of students we managed\r\n          Homework Helping Club for 3 months. Thus, it was fantastic. Next is,\r\n          we also had launched some projects outside the valley. Few members of\r\n          HAND went to Dhading for children career counselling. And in\r\n          Okhaldhunga HAND participated actively to establish library. It was\r\n          highly appreciated by the people of okhaldhunga. Therefore, in coming\r\n          days we will have more programs that would work for the betterment of\r\n          child mental health.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </Section1>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Alumni;\r\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\r\n\r\nimport ImageHeader from \"../../contents/ImageHeader\";\r\nimport test from \"../../../assets/imageheaderphotos/test.JPG\";\r\nimport Meta from \"../../contents/Meta\";\r\n\r\nconst Section1 = styled.div`\r\n  color: #111;\r\n  line-height: 28px;\r\n  text-align: justify;\r\n  font-weight: 400;\r\n  font-size: 18px;\r\n  h3 {\r\n    margin: 50px 0 20px 0;\r\n    color: #222222;\r\n    font-weight: 600;\r\n    text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n  }\r\n  ul {\r\n    margin-bottom: 80px;\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst Scholarship = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <Meta title=\"Scholarship\" />\r\n      <ImageHeader mtitle=\"Scholarship\" title=\"Scholarship\" image={test} />\r\n      <Section1 className=\"container\">\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h3>Scholarship Provision</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Heartland is the school not for profit with service orientation and\r\n            providing scholarship opportunities to the underprivileged families\r\n            across the country.

This year, Heartland\r\n            college is entering into 13 th year of service to the country’s\r\n            academic sector. During all these years, we have prioritized\r\n            teaching learning to move towards achieving our primary vision of\r\n            becoming the center of academic excellence. We are committed towards\r\n            our mission to endow our students with skills and attributes of an\r\n            ingenious problem solver and critical thinker. We at Heartland are\r\n            very aware that we can easily fall into the trap of conventional\r\n            teaching. We understand that we have to embrace an interactive\r\n            teaching approach with extensive practical works, field works,\r\n            project works etc. that can make learning a real life experience.\r\n            This is only way to prepare our students to confidently face the\r\n            challenges of the highly competitive world and career progression\r\n            and also nurture them to become responsible human beings who are\r\n            capable to effectively deliver the needs of a developing nation. I\r\n            once again welcome you all to join our family.
