          <h3>Scholarship Provision</h3>
          <p>
            Heartland is a not-for-profit school with a service orientation, 
            providing scholarship opportunities to the underprivileged families 
            across the country from Nursery to grade 12 (tertiary sector). The 
            process is one in which, existing Heartland families are informed 
            throughout the academic session regarding application dates for scholarship. 
            Upon application they must submit documentation specified by the school along 
            with their local government recommendation letter. The collected documents are 
            verified with the schoolâ€™s scholarship committee at Heartland and then sent onto
            CLCR Australia/ Nepal for consideration. The selected students are given 100% 
            scholarship to study at Heartland up to year 12. Also, those students are supported 
            with 2 pairs of the schools uniform each year along with stationery materials and funding 
            for educational tours throughout the year as part of extra-curricular activities.

              We provide several different scholarships based on the following criteria.
